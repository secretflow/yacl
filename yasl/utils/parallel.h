/*
parallel_reduce

begin: index at which to start applying reduction

end: index at which to stop applying reduction

grain_size: number of elements per chunk. impacts number of elements in
intermediate results tensor and degree of parallelization.

ident: identity for binary combination function sf. sf(ident, x) needs to return
x.

f: function for reduction over a chunk. f needs to be of signature scalar_t
f(int64_t partial_begin, int64_t partial_end, scalar_t identifiy)

sf: function to combine two partial results. sf needs to be of signature
scalar_t sf(scalar_t x, scalar_t y)

For example, you might have a tensor of 10000 entires and want to sum together
all the elements. Parallel_reduce with a grain_size of 2500 will then allocate
an intermediate result tensor with 4 elements. Then it will execute the function
"f" you provide and pass the beginning and end index of these chunks, so
0-2499, 2500-4999, etc. and the combination identity. It will then write out
the result from each of these chunks into the intermediate result tensor. After
that it'll reduce the partial results from each chunk into a single number using
the combination function sf and the identity ident. For a total summation this
would be "+" and 0 respectively. This is similar to tbb's approach [1], where
you need to provide a function to accumulate a subrange, a function to combine
two partial results and an identity.

Warning: parallel_reduce does NOT copy thread local
states from the current thread to the worker threads.
This means for example that Tensor operations CANNOT be used in the
body of your function, only data pointers.
