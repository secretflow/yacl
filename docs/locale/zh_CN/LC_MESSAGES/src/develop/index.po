"**For Traditioanl PKI:** Since there are so many existing time-proof, "
"efficient, and standardized implementation of PKI algorithms, Yacl **does"
" not re-implement** those algorithms. Instead, Yacl only provides a "
"light-weighted and \"easy-to-use\" wrapper for the most popular "
"industrial libraries (e.g. `OpenSSL <https://openssl.org/>`_, `TongSuo "
"<https://github.com/Tongsuo-Project>`_, `LibSodium "
"<https://doc.libsodium.org/>`_, etc.)"

"**For ECC (Elliptic-Curve Cryptography):** Yacl integrates many curve "
"implementation from OpenSSL, you may use the code in the following to use"
" any curve as you like. For more information about all supported curve "
"names, see: `yacl/crypto/ecc/curve_meta.cc "

"**For Randomness** Yacl has also provide some easy-to-use randomness "
"generation functions. Random functions usually start with **Secure** or "
"**Fast**, secure random implementation uses the standardized ctr-drbg, "
"and fast uses hash-drbg. It is always recommended to use "
"**Secure**-Random functions."

"**For Secure Computation Protocols:** Yacl provides many secure "
"computation primitives, such as OT, VOLE and so on. It is recommended to "
"use the `yacl/kernel/...` api for general usage. For more advanced users,"
" please use `yacl/algorithms/...`."

"**ECDH-PSI Example:** We also provide a step-to-step demo to demonstrate "
"how to build an ECDH-PSI protocol from the tools that Yacl provides, and "
"then bind the protocol implementation to JAVA and Python. See the "
"following link for more detail."
