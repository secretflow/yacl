"YACL (Yet Another Common Cryptography Library) is a sub-project of "
"`SecretFlow <https://github.com/secretflow/>`_, it is a C++ library that "
"provides cryptography, network and io modules for other SecretFlow "
"repositories. Yacl is designed to be a **low-level** library that could "
"be either integrated into a big **secure system**, or used in a "
"standalone way for a **quick POC** (see: `Develop "
"<src/develop/index>`_), or even help with your "
"**security/cryptography research** (see: `Research "
"<src/research/index>`_)."

"**About Cryptography Modules:** The crypto modules in Yacl implement many"
" state-of-art secure computation protocols, including primitives like OT,"
" VOLE, TPRE, and tools like PRG, RO. Check the full list of Yacl's "
"`supported algorithms list <src/algorithms>`_."

"**About Network (\"link\") Modules:** The network (\"link\") module in "
"Yacl uses `BRPC <https://brpc.apache.org/>`_ to handle network. And we "
"also provide a \"mocked\" in-memory link."
